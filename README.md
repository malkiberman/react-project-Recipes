Final React Project - Recipes and Authentication Process

Project Description

This is a React 19 project featuring a recipe management system with account creation and login functionality. Logged-in users can add new recipes, while all users can view the recipe list. The project integrates a client-side application written in React with a Node.js server-side component.

Key Technologies

React 19 with TypeScript

React Router for navigation management

MUI for UI styling

Yup + React Hook Form for recipe submission form validation

Context API + Reducer for global state management of login

MobX for managing recipe state

Fetch / Axios for API calls with predefined error handling (e.g., 401 errors)

Node.js + Express for the backend server
